## Featured Projects

### Purple App Backend Authentication and Functionality
A social-media style platform centered around music events.  
**Tech:** Node.js, Firebase Auth, Firestore, Cloud Functions  
- Implemented user authentication and profile management  
- Designed backend APIs and data models  
- Collaborated in a team environment using Git branching

### 🔹 Apex Era — Business Analytics Dashboard & Ticketing System  
A data-driven platform designed to help trade workers manage leads, analyze business performance, and track customer interactions.
**Tech:** Node.js, REST APIs, Database Design  
- Developed backend services for lead management, ticketing, and analytics workflows  
- Designed database schemas to support customer data, service tickets, and performance metrics  
- Built and integrated RESTful APIs for scalable data access and system communication  
- Focused on real-world business requirements, data integrity, and maintainable system design  

### Legal Lens - HenHacks 24 Hour Coding Competition 2025
A web application designed to help users better understand legal documents by breaking down complex language into clear, accessible insights.
**Tech:** Node.js, Firebase, PostgreSQL, REST APIs  
- Built backend services to handle user data, document processing, and authentication  
- Designed and integrated structured database schemas for storing legal content and user interactions  
- Implemented secure API endpoints to support document analysis workflows  
- Focused on clean architecture, scalability, and maintainable backend design  
- Collaborated in a team-based environment using Git and GitHub for version control

### Pokémon BattleDex (Website + Database)  
A database-driven web app that helps players plan better Pokémon battles by exploring Pokémon types, stats, abilities, and moves in one place.
**Tech:** PostgreSQL, SQL, HTML/CSS, JavaScript  
- Designed a relational **PostgreSQL** schema to model Pokémon battle data (Pokémon, Types, Moves, Abilities, Base Stats)  
- Built the website UI to browse and filter Pokémon information for strategy and matchup planning  
- Wrote SQL queries to support common lookups (type effectiveness, move details, stat comparisons)  
- Ensured normalized tables and clear relationships (1–many, many–many) to keep data consistent and scalable  
- Documented the conceptual design (entity sets + attributes) and mapped it into a relational model  

### Bit by Bit (Object-Oriented Java Game)  
A text-based adventure game set inside a computer system, where the player navigates digital components as “Bit” in search of their counterpart “Byte.”
**Tech:** Java, Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures  
- Designed using core **OOP principles** (encapsulation, abstraction, modular class design)  
- Modeled game elements (rooms, items, NPCs, actions) as reusable objects  
- Implemented structured navigation, interaction commands, and state management  
- Incorporated resource constraints (memory, inventory limits) to mirror real system behavior  
- Emphasized clean architecture and extensibility over graphics  

## Goals

- Secure a **Software Engineering Internship (Summer 2026)**
- Create a sizable project and leverage it into launch
- Improve proficiency in data structures, algorithms, and technical problem solving
